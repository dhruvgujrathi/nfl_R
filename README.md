We were given the task of finding the probability of winning a certain amount of money after betting on the three games between two National Football League (NFL) teams, namely New York Giants (NYG) and Cincinnati Bengals (CB). Both the teams have to play a best of three games series and the one who wins two out of the three games, wins the series. Now, the probability of winning at the team’s home ground is obviously higher. So, since the first game is played at New York’s home ground, their winning probability was higher. The second game was to be played at Cincinnati Bengal’s home ground, thus their winning probability will be higher. And, if at all a third game is needed, then it will be played at the New York Giant’s home ground, where the wining probability of the New York Giants is high. Based on the above information, we had to bet on each game played and if the New York Giants won, then we won $500 and if they lost or if the Cincinnati Bengals won, then we would lose $520.
